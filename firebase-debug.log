[info] i  extensions: answer the questions below to configure your extension:
[info] 
Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension?  You usually want a location close to your Storage bucket. For help selecting a  location, refer to the location selection  guide (https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).
[info] 
Cloud Storage bucket for images: To which Cloud Storage bucket will you upload images that you want to resize? Resized images will be stored in this bucket. Depending on your extension configuration, original images are either kept or deleted.
[info] 
Sizes of resized images: What sizes of images would you like (in pixels)? Enter the sizes as a comma-separated list of WIDTHxHEIGHT values. Learn more about how this parameter works (https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/storage-resize-images).
[info] 
Deletion of original file: Do you want to automatically delete the original file from the Cloud Storage bucket? Note that these deletions cannot be undone.
[info] 
Cloud Storage path for resized images (Optional): A relative path in which to store resized images. For example, if you specify a path here of thumbs and you upload an image to /images/original.jpg, then the resized image is stored at /images/thumbs/original_200x200.jpg. If you prefer to store resized images at the root of your bucket, leave this field empty.
[info] 
Cache-Control header for resized images (Optional): This extension automatically copies any Cache-Control metadata from the original image to the resized images. For the resized images, do you want to overwrite this copied Cache-Control metadata or add Cache-Control metadata? Learn more about Cache-Control headers (https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control). If you prefer not to overwrite or add Cache-Control metadata, leave this field empty.
